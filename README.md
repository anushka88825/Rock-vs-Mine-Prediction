Brief Summary of the Project:-
The following prediction of Rock and Mine is for submarines, so that they can predict the incoming objects correctly
The data is from a labortary where the sound signals detect a rock and a metal container 
In this project the classification models evaluation is also done based on their accuracy score
The used supervised classification models are:- Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor
And at last the Predictive System shows that the selected model is predicting the object correctly on some sample input data
